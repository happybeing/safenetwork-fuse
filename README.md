# DEPRECATED

This repo has been superceded by [safe-drive](https://github.com/theWebalyst/safe-drive).

A new repo was created rather than a simple re-naming to simplify removing some large blobs that were pushed before I realised what a bad idea that was. 

This repo containers earlier versions of the code, including a release of built SAFE Drive / SAFE FUSE executable: [safenetwork-fuse v0.1.0](https://github.com/theWebalyst/safenetwork-fuse/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

New issues on this repo will be ignored.
